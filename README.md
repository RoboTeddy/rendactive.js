rendactive.js
=============

Experimental reactive template rendering with Bacon.js + Meteor Spark

Bacon.js: https://github.com/raimohanska/bacon.js
Spark: https://github.com/meteor/meteor/wiki/Spark

This is just a proof-of-concept so far -- it's not recommended for real use. The API is probably too limited/sucky for anything serious.

Example (flickr instant search with pagination):

Example source is in `src/example.coffee`
